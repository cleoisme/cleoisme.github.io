[The Centre for Teaching, Learning, and Technology](https://ctlt.ubc.ca/) (CTLT) primarily focuses on professional development in teaching and learning, offering technical support for projects led by UBC faculties. The project I contributed to is [Tapestry Tool](https://www.home.tapestry-tool.com/) led by [Dr. Steven Barnes](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/steven-barnes/), which has evolved into an open-source online learning platform. This platform facilitates collaboration among users, authors, viewers, students, and instructors in the creation of interactive, associative, and multi-modal content.
