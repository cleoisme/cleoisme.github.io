description: "Cleoisme is a comprehensive full-stack project that serves as a centralized platform for organizing my personal experiences and resources. It comprises a captivating front-end web page designed for presentation, a CMS that enables CRUD operations on a dedicated database. This project is intended for long-term development and aims to keep up with the times. On one hand, Cleoisme functions as a personal chronicle in terms of content. On the other hand, it serves as a carrier for me to explore cutting-edge technologies from a development perspective."
