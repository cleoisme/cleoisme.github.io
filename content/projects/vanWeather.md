Feedbacks From Nazar:
Overall, great work on your final project and a very interesting concept! I’ve included some additional thoughts below:
- Awesome outline of the question you are answering and your methodology. You provided enough background and data source information for me to quickly grasp what is the topic
- Very interesting topic and challenging task to predict the weather.
- I loved the comparison by bubble size between months. You made a clear point there.
- As the rule of thumb, I suggest always showing what vertical and horizontal axis means on the graph
- Amazing choice of a scatter plot to show the chance of raining. Love it. One thing to consider is throwing in too many comparisons into one graph. Please keep in mind that your audience has several seconds to grasp your point and it might be challenging if there are several differentiators: colour, shape, two axes. As the rule of thumb, different colours and different shapes do not get along together.
- You took a very good approach to highlight the problems with the datasets. Usually, nobody has perfect data and it’s worth being mindful about limitations.

It was great having you in class & good luck playing around with the different tools and all the best in your career!

Feedbacks From Parveen:
- General
    I appreciated the topic you chose. It always helps to be personally invested in your analysis – this brought your
    topic alive and had the audience invested in your presentation!
- Question
    Your presentation would have been best phrased as “Describing the trend of weather” versus maybe predicting.
    Predictive analysis is a concept in itself. It is indeed possible to make recommendations based on a descriptive analysis, but “predicting” is a different concept.
- Data
    I appreciated how well versed you were in your data source. This built trust with the audience.
- Analysis & Visualization
    I appreciated the way you took time to define your own metrics with the given data (e.g. rainy day versus not rainy day).
    Great walk through of the visualizations so the audience had time to digest the information.
- Conclusions
    It was wonderful to hear the assumptions you found built into your analysis, these may have been better shared
    at the beginning and instead using this conclusion time to highlight the key findings.
