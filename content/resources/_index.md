description: "I hold the belief that 'working alone makes you go fast and working together makes you go further', so this section aims to provide a curated collection of resources meticulously gathered for fellow developers and to foster community support. I will update the list from time to time along with my professional journey, and hope it helps you too!!"

I have categorized the content into three sections: CS Fundamentals, Job Hunting, and Industrial Practices. This approach offers you various entry points and perspectives to explore the field of Computer Science - ultimately, they are all interconnected.

### 文 - CS Fundamentals
This section lists fundamental and advanced subjects covered in the Computer Science curriculum at most schools. Although these topics may not have an immediate impact on your programming skills or career growth, they are essential for fostering a profound comprehension of how computers operate. Consider learning these subjects as a long-term value investment that will significantly contribute to your future without you realizing it.

|Fundamental                              |Advanced                     |

|Computer Systems                         |Computer Architecture        |
|                                         |Microcomputer Design         |
|Computer Hardware and Operating Systems  |Distributed System           |
|Cybersecurity                            | |
|Algorithms, Data Structures and Analysis |Algorithm Design             |
|                                         |Machine Learning             |

|Computer Communications/Network          | |
|Database Systems Concepts & Design       | |

### 技 - Job Hunting
This section focuses on job search related topics, including resume editing, the interview process, types of companies, job search platforms, and more. Technical assessment holds significant importance within this context. Job searching requires considerable effort, and the preparation involved is relatively separate from the other two sections.
